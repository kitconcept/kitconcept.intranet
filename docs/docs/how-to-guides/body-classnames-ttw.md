# Inject body tag classnames Trough the Web (TTW)

This document describes how to inject body tag classnames TTW (through the web) in a Plone site or subsite.
It is a feature that relies on a control panel configuration.
At this point (August 2025), it is placed in the kitconcept intranet distribution control panel, but it can be moved to a more appropriate place in the future.

## Adding body tag classnames

Go to the kitconcept intranet control panel and look for the "Body Tag Classnames" field.
You can add classnames that will be injected in the body tag of the site.
You can add multiple classnames, and they must be separated by spaces.
